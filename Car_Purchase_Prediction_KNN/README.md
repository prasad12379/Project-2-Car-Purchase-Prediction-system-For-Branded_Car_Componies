## Dataset

- **Observations:** 400 records
- **Features:**  
  - `Age`  
  - `Estimated Salary`  
  - `Purchased` (Target: 0 or 1)

## What I Did

1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Applied preprocessing and feature scaling  
3. Split the data into:
   - **75% training**
   - **25% testing**
4. Trained a **K-Nearest Neighbors** classifier  
5. Achieved **93% accuracy** on the test data ðŸŽ¯
